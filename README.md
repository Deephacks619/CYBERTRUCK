# CYBERTRUCK
This is all about the futuristic and funky car .Its just awesome tesla car.
The building quality is just awesome guyss.



Tesla Cybertruck is an upcoming all-electric battery-powered light commercial vehicle in development by Tesla, Inc. Three models have been announced, with range estimates of 250–500 miles (400–800 km) and an estimated 0–60 mph time of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model.

The stated goal of the Tesla in developing Cybertruck is to provide a sustainable energy option for the roughly 6,500 fossil fuel powered trucks sold per day in the US.

The base price of the rear-wheel drive model of the vehicle will be $39,900, with all-wheel drive models starting at $49,900.

# Features

The truck will use self-leveling suspension which compensates for variable load and some models will have all-wheel drive. Other standard features include on-board power inverters for supplying both 120 and 240-Volt electricity, allowing use of power tools without a portable generator. An air compressor for powering pneumatic tools is included. All vehicles will also come standard with Tesla Autopilot, and will have the hardware capabilities for fully autonomous operation.[citation needed] As of November 2019 Tesla is accepting pre-orders for a $7,000 'full self-driving' option.

Range of the Cybertruck varies from 250 to 500+ miles (400 to 800+ km), depending on configuration selections.

The stainless steel exterior is bullet-resistant against 9 mm caliber bullets.

# Timeline

In 2012 and 2013 Elon Musk discussed the desire to build a truck with load-compensating suspension, making comparisons with a Ford F-250. In early-2014 Musk predicted 4–5 years before work could start on the product.

In mid-2016, Musk outlined the intent for a new kind of consumer pickup truck, and suggested using the same chassis for a van and a pickup truck. In late-2017, the size was estimated to be at least that of a Ford F-150, in order to be large enough to enable a "game-changing" feature. During the Tesla Semi and Tesla Roadster unveiling in November 2017, a picture of a "pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck" was displayed. Background ideas had been in preparation for nearly five years.

In 2018 Musk speculated on the possibility of a tail lift allowing easier access to ground-level, designed using a four-bar linkage. As of late-2018, Tesla was working on two approaches for the van project: either using a bare-bones Mercedes-Benz Sprinter glider chassis, with Tesla then adding electric transmission, battery and electronics; or alternatively designing and manufacturing the complete vehicle to a Tesla design, requiring more time. At that time Musk anticipated a prototype to be ready to show in 2019.

In February 2019, the CEO of Daimler Dieter Zetsche stated that talks with Tesla had been initiated via Jerome Guillen, and were on-going.

In March 2019, following the Tesla Model Y launch, Elon Musk distributed a teaser image of a vehicle described as having a cyberpunk or Blade Runner style, with the form resembling a futuristic armoured personnel carrier.

In mid-2019, the towing capacity of the vehicle was stated to meet or exceed a Ford F-150. Musk noted plans for an amphibious vehicle based partly on Wet Nellie, the submarine car from the film The Spy Who Loved Me. Musk had purchased a Wet Nellie used in the filming at a 2013 Sotheby's auction. 

# Design

## Specifications
All models of the Cybertruck will have the following features standard: 250kW+ Supercharging capability, Autopilot, Adaptive Air Suspension, on-board 120/240V AC outlets.

The vehicle features an exoskeleton rather than a chassis. Motor Trend noticed the polygonal origami-folded 3 millimeter 301 stainless steel unibody rather than the traditional curved truck stamped panel body-on-frame construction, thus comparing it to Picasso's cubism, the DMC DeLorean, and the Chrysler Airflow. The powertrain is similar to the Model S/X, with an inductive rear motor and the Model 3's permanent-magnet in front for the medium model. Other versions are single-motor rear wheel drive, or tri-motor.

Similarly to Tesla's other vehicle offerings, customers can pre-order the Full Self Driving software upgrade, adding an additional $7,000 to the price of the configuration.

Tesla Cybertruck model specifications
    
|model| range |top speed| price|
|-----|------|-------|-------|
|Single Motor RWD|250+ miles / 400 km|177 km/h|$39,900|
|Dual Motor AWD	|300+ miles / 482 km |193km/h|$49,900|
|Tri Motor AWD |	500+ miles / 800 km|209 km/h |$69,900|


All specifications will have 100 cubic feet (2.8 m3) of storage space, and a 6.5-foot-long (2.0 m) cargo area. As on off-road vehicle, 16 inches (40 cm) of ground clearance is provided, with a 35 degree approach angle, and 28 degree departure angle.

# Unveiling

## Planning
In response to queries for an unveiling date, on 27 July 2019 Musk stated "We're close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months", indicating late-2019. The unveiling was scheduled for 21 November 2019 at the Tesla Design Studio, next to SpaceX headquarters in Los Angeles—the same month, year and location as Blade Runner is set in.

## Presentation
During the presentation, Musk demonstrated the durability of the vehicle and its materials. Despite successful drop tests conducted on a pane of the specialized 'Tesla armor glass' and a successful pre-show test where a steel ball was thrown at the windows of the truck itself by chief of design Franz von Holzhausen with apparently no damage, the windows were damaged when Holzhausen repeated the test during the show. Musk jokingly exclaimed that "the ball didn't make it through" and "we'll fix it in post" after the unexpected outcomes.

Before ending the presentation, a Tesla-designed electric ATV was driven onto the stage, which was then loaded onto the bed of the truck using built-in ramps in the tailgate. The ATV rider proceeded to plug in the vehicle into the Cybertruck's onboard power outlet to charge the ATV.

## Reactions

The Cybertruck unveiling event was covered heavily by traditional media and online blogs/social media. In social media, many commentators expressed dislike of the sharp contours and unusual exterior of the Cybertruck.

Tesla, Inc. stock was down 6% following the Cybertruck announcement. 

On 23 November 2019, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla had received 146,000 pre-orders in the first 1 1/2 days after the unveiling—each requiring a US$100 refundable deposit—with 42% choosing the dual-motor configuration, 41% choosing the tri-motor configuration, and 17% choosing the single-motor configuration. On 3:18 AM - Nov 25, 2019, this number rose to 200,000.

# Production
Tesla Cybertruck production is scheduled to start in late 2021 and expand to offer more configurations in 2022.

Market Potential
In the United States, the total addressable market for full-sized pickup trucks is over two million vehicles per year. It has been argued that the Cybertruck will be able to take advantage of the Tesla Networks to generate an income stream, as the latter were to become available.
